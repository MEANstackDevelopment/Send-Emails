# Send Emails with Node.js

 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol for sending e-mail messages between servers.
 SMTP is the main transport used by nodemailer for delivering messages.

 Mailtrap is a "fake SMTP server" used for development purposes. Instead of having to test your code with your own email account, and potentially flooding your inbox with test emails, you can instead use Mailtrap as the endpoint.
